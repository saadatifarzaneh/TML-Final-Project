# TML Final Project

This repository contains the implementation of the final project for the **Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML)** course. The project focuses of one of the key aspect of trustworthy AI, including interpretability, implemented using PyTorch.

---

## Introduction

Trustworthy Machine Learning aims to ensure machine learning models are interpretable to adversarial scenarios. This project "Enhancing Interpretability of Protein Sequence Embeddings
through Unsupervised Clustering", demonstrates how this principle can be applied to real-world problems using PyTorch for model development, training, and evaluation. 

## Features

- **Deep Learning Implementation**: End-to-end pipeline using PyTorch.
- **Custom Dataset Handling**: Includes implementations for Dataset and DataLoader.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**: Scripts for performance metrics and detailed visualizations.
- **Trustworthy AI Focus**: Explores interpretability
